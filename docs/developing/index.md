title: Developing Node-RED
---

Eventually, we will have some good documentation on the internals of Node-RED to
make it easier for anyone to get involved with its development.

In the meantime:

 - Here are our [Contribution Guidelines](/about/contribute/)
 - Various design notes are on the [wiki](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/wiki)

If this is an area you are interested in, come talk to us in the [forum](https://discourse.nodered.org)
or [Slack team](/slack).

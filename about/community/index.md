### Discussion

The two main places to discuss Node-RED are:

 - the [Node-RED forum](https://discourse.nodered.org)
 - the [slack team](https://nodered.org/slack)

The project used the Google Groups based [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-red), but
that is now a read-only archive..

These are the best places to get started if you're stuck on something, think you may
have hit a bug, have a suggestion for the greatest feature ever or if you just
want to say hello.

If you have a specific question to ask, you can also head over to
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red) and use
the tag `node-red`.

The project is [@NodeRED](https://twitter.com/nodered) on Twitter, which we use
for general announcements and links. You may also want to follow [@red_nodes](https://twitter.com/red_nodes)
which provides a feed of nodes published to the [flow library](https://flows.nodered.org).

### Community Survey

We ran our first community-wide survey in March/April 2019. The results are
available [here](/about/community/survey/2019).
